I'm a recovering sales addict now hooked on web development.

I currently work as a sales rep at Egencia. I help simplify the way mid-market companies book and manage employee travel.

Outside of work, I build 🔨 projects like
watchnow ai logoWatchNow AI, run 🏃‍♂️ way too many miles, and spend time with my beautiful wife, daughter and son 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦.
