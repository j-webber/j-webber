### Hey there, I'm Joe 👋

- I'm a self-taught developer looking for my next full-time opportunity. If you're interesting in working together send me an email at joe@joewebber.me.
- I use daily: `.js`, `.jsx`, `.html`, `.css`
- Outside of work, I'm building 🔨 [WatchNow AI](https://watchnowai.com), running 🏃‍♂️ way too many miles, and spending time with my beautiful wife, daughter, and son 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦.

### What I'm working on
- 🎥 [WatchNow AI](https://watchnowai.com) - **AI-powered movie recs** - The project that started it all. I spent 6-months learning how to code in order to build V1. Since then I've rebuilt it more times than I'd like to admit, help thousands find a movie to watch, and made enought to buy bought a few bags of ramen along the way 😉.
